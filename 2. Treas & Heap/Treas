1. Write an implementation of Treap (using either static or user-input values)
2. Create a function for insert, remove and search. 
3. Simulate the results (you may show the AVL rotations) on how the values were inserted
and removed.

If you still have time:

1. Compare it using a Tree and a Heap. 
2. Create another function for split and merge. (segmented trees)
